Binary systems to test:
Cu-Cr - There is horizontal Liquidus line when all phases of the tdb are selected.
        If only ['LIQUID','FCC_A1','BCC_A2'] are selected, the phase diagram is good. It shows miscibility gap in liquid

Cu-Ni - Good, binary diagram with miscibility in the FCC region with all phases selected from the tdb

Cu-Zr - Good, binary diagram with all phases selected in the tdb

Cr-Zr - Good agreement

Cr-Ni - Good at high temperature, fails a bit in the Ni rich corner at low temperature

Zr-Ni - If all phases from the database are selected, an invariant reaction between NI21ZR8 and NI10ZR7 is missing.
	Good, only when selected Zr-Ni phases:  
        ['LIQUID','FCC_A1','HCP_A3','BCC_A2','NI5ZR','NI7ZR2','NI3ZR','NI21ZR8','NI10ZR7','NI11ZR9','NIZR','ZR2NI']
	GOOD if all phases are selected, except TAO phase which is commented in the database



Adding silicon, we would need the binaries:
Cu-Si - Not good at the Si end
Cr-Si
Zr-Si
Ni-Si
